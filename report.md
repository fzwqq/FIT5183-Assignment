Verification and Validation â€“ **Tester** role



1. Assignment Phase 1 group work is divided into 3 tasks. Each task is completed by all of us. Among them, I am mainly responsible for testing. The main tasks of the test include but are not limited to:
  1. Check if the code logic is reasonable; whether the data is abnormal;
  2. Prepare the test data set to unit test each function and feed the test results back to the designer;
  3. Communicate with the function implementer for abnormal and unconsidered extremes and propose possible modifications;
  4. Whether the functions implemented by the comparison match meet the task requirements.
        Finally, through this assignment, I realized that correct interpretation of the task requirements is like accurately understanding the customer's product requirements; mainly improving the ability to read and analyze other people's code; team communication and coordination capabilities.
